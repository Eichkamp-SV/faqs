## Questions and Answers

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I use the washing machines?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

First, you need a **MensaCard.** This student ID (Campuscard) can be picked up at a distribution machine at your university, if you haven’t got yours yet.
Many of you already have one included into the student ID (participating universities at the moment: FU Berlin, HU Berlin, HTW, HWR, Beuth, Charité, ehb, ASH, KSHB). 
If you study at a different university, you probably got a seperate MensaCard via postal mail, and if you didn’t, you can get one at any Mensa of studierendenWERK Berlin (nearest one is TU Mensa, Hardenbergstr.), check at which time it’s open! 
You can also get one at the MensaTruck that is arriving usually once a week at Eichkamp (see more on https://stw.berlin)

Then you also have to **top up your MensaCard** (add credit to it). This usually only works by cash bills! You can top it up at the MensaTruck or at any studierendenWERK Mensa in Berlin.

With that prep out of the way **go to the washing machine room** in the basement of Haus 9 (it has a separate entrance). **[To the map](#Map-of-Eichkamp-dormitory)**

Follow the instructions displayed there (Load your clothes, up to 5kg. Select a program. Pay with the Mensa Card after selecting the machine with YOUR clothes. Go back to the machine and start the cycle. Remember to tmel).

**Costs:** 

* Washing (2 to 3 EUR)
* drying (1 to 2 EUR) 

per cycle/load depending on the temperature of the water or the length of the drying.  
You don’t have to bring your own detergent, it is included in the price.

If you have any questions, you can contact your roommates, the tutors or the SV.

<summary><strong>How can I use Internet in Eichkamp?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

There are two ways to connect. First, there is eduroam Wi-Fi available at many places on the site. There you can just log in with your university account. How that works depends on your university or high school. Just check the configuration settings at your high school’s website. There is also a universal tool that should work for many universities: https://cat.eduroam.org/  

The second way, which is highly recommended in terms of stability, reliability and speed, is to use your own router. Every room and WG should have a separate WAN-port, which you can use to connect to your own router’s WAN port. Normally it just works after you plug in the cable. Note that there is Gigabit internet available in Eichkamp (which is very fast!), so to get the most out of your connection, make sure to use a router that supports that, e.g. Asus RT-AC53 or Fritz!Box 4040.

<summary><strong>What is the SV and the tutors?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

The tutors are students who live in the dormitory and are here to help new residents and to organize events! They are employed by the STW and have consultation hours. If you want to know when they are, you can look at their door at house 15, in front of the postboxes! You can also reach the tutors via the email address tutor.eichkamp@stw.berlin.

There is also an extra tutor for the fitness room and the music room in the clubhouse. If you want to get access to the rooms, you can contact him via email: fitness.musik.tutor@gmail.com 

The SV is the student self administration of the dormitory. The current SV was newly founded in November 2020. They consist of voluntary people living here, and they also can organize events, but can do even more than that, e.g. building up a bicycle workshop or running a bar. They also get access to some rooms, material and money to realize their ideas. If you are interested in volunteering for your dormitory, please contact us! We are always happy about new people joining us! You can contact the SV directly via email (eichkamp.sv@gmail.com) or via Instagram ([@eichkamp.sv](https://instagram.com/eichkamp.sv))

<summary><strong>What are the tasks of the caretakers? How to contact them?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

The caretakers / janitors are mainly responsible for the maintenance of the dormitory. If something breaks in your community kitchen or bathroom, you can contact them, also if something with the internet connection, heating, water or similar does not work. They are available during their office hours in their office at the back of house 15. Also you can contact them via email (wh.ek@stw.berlin) or phone: 

0151 16600290 (Herr Bartholdi)  
0151 16600291 (Herr Schlüter)  
0151 16600287 (Herr Schulze)

<summary><strong>Do I have to pay Rundfunkbeitrag?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

The studierendenWERK tells everybody who is renting a single room (no WG) to pay Rundfunkbeitrag on their own. WGs only have to pay the Rundfunkbeitrag once. 

However, the [regulation that is stated in all publically available materials by the Beitragsservice](https://www.rundfunkbeitrag.de/welcome/englisch/students_and_apprentices/index_ger.html#i_live_in_a_student_hall_of_residence_do_i_have_to_pay) (the authority who is responsible for collecting the Rundfunkbeitrag) is different: It says that only rooms, who are directly connected to a public corridor are considered as separate flats and have to pay Rundfunkbeitrag. If your room is not connected to a public corridor (and another door is in between), then you can share the Rundfunkbeitrag among everybody on your floor. This is the case in some houses in Eichkamp, but not in all. In this case, it is also recommended for the other flatmates that don't pay the fee directly to register at Beitragsservice though and refer to the flatmate that already pays. This can avoid conflicts.

Btw: The Beitragsservice has no capacities to come and check every single door constellation (also confirmed by an employee from Beitragsservice), so it's up to you and your flatmates how you want to handle the situation.

More on that: https://rundfunkbeitrag.de

<summary><strong>What can I do in case of an emergency (no water, heating, electricity, internet)?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

If there is an emergency with water, heating, electricity, internet while the caretakers are out of office, you can call the emergency numbers that are displayed near the entrance of each house. Notice that if you call them in a situation that is not an emergency or the caretakers are available, you have to pay the service by yourself.

<summary><strong>How can I open the front gate if it’s closed?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

There is a phone number you can call to open the gate instantly. For security, we do not share the number here publically, but you can [join our Telegram group](https://forms.gle/oHzzffdwopxoh39w6). The number is linked in the group description. Additionally, if you own a private car, you can ask the caretakers for a chip card.

Notice that the gate opens inductively from the inside, so if you drag e.g. a magnetic bike over the area right behind the gate, it will open automatically. That also means, if you want to drive from inside to the outside, the gate always opens automatically without further chip cards, etc.

<summary><strong>How can I use the fitness or the music room?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

There is a special tutor for the fitness room and the music room in the clubhouse. You can contact him via email: fitness.musik.tutor@gmail.com 

If you want to get access to the fitness room, please fill in this form: https://forms.gle/SLHtYjDzWhKHstsDA
    
**Note:** The music room is unfortunately still closed at the moment but will hopefully back soon.

<summary><strong>How can I use the table tennis room?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

If the room is open, you can just go inside and play :)

**Note:** Due to the current Corona situation, the table tennis room is currently closed.

<summary><strong>How can I receive postal mails and parcels in Eichkamp? Is there a public parcel box?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

**Your VO-Number** (that one that starts with 761-...) always has to be mentioned in the address field, so that the postman knows where to put your letter or where to bring your parcel. This number includes our house number, your floor number and your room number, in that order. 

“761” just stands for the Eichkamp dormitory in general. So for example: “761-05-03-01-0” would be the VO-No for house 5, floor 3 (the first floor ist floor 0), room 3, person 0. Alternatively, the parcel or letter can contain something as “Haus 5, Etage 3, Zimmer 1” or similar.

Often there are **parcels lost or received by another person** instead of the actual recipient. This is somehow annoying, but in many cases this just happens because the house number or VO number is missing. Unfortunately, there is no public parcel box in Eichkamp at the moment, where parcel services could just bring the packages if they do not find the receiving person. Because of strict regulations with Denkmalschutz and Brandschutz, this is unfortunately very difficult to implement.

<summary><strong>What should I do if I accidentally received a postal mail or a parcel that is not for me?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

If you find a letter in your postbox that is addressed to another person, you can either give it to the person directly or throw it in their postbox if you know them. If you don’t know them, you have to make sure it is sent back to the sender. To do so, just throw the letter into a postal box of Deutsche Post. If you want, you can write “Empfänger unbekannt” on the envelope before. If the letter was sent via some other carrier than Deutsche Post (e.g. pin Mail), you can give it back to the carrier. You are not allowed by law to open the letter or to throw it away!

If you received a parcel for another person you don’t know, please [join the Eichkamp Telegram group](https://forms.gle/oHzzffdwopxoh39w6) and ask if the person can pick up the parcel from you.

<summary><strong>What is the food truck?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

The food truck is an offer by studierendenWERK Berlin and it usually stays once a week in Eichkamp dormitory, but this may change in the future. It arrives at 11am and leaves at 2:30pm. You can buy food here, freshly made and ready-to-eat, or cold meals that you can warm up later. Additionally, there are salads, desserts, cake, some drinks, and ice cream in summer. You can look up the menu [at the STW website](https://www.stw.berlin/en/dining-facilities/foodtruck-mensa-ontheroad.html).

You can also get a new MensaCard here if you don’t have one yet, and you can top up your MensaCard with cash bills. At the truck, you can pay with MensaCard only to get the cheap student price, if you can only pay without MensaCard (Girocard, credit card or Google Pay) you have to pay the more expensive guest price.

<summary><strong>How can I print or scan things in Eichkamp?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

At the moment, there is no place where everybody can print or scan things. Some people might have a private printer or scanner though. If you ask nicely [in the Telegram group](https://forms.gle/oHzzffdwopxoh39w6), maybe there is somebody who can help you out. Otherwise there are multiple options to print in the area: 

* McPaper at Reichsstraße, near Theodor Heuss Platz
* Postbank at Soorstraße, near Theodor Heuss Platz
* digital-print-service at Kaiserdamm 
* And more! Just search for “copyshop” in your maps application.

Currently, the SV and other people are trying to implement a printing and scanning service directly in Eichkamp.

<summary><strong>What is the Bar? Is there any chance it will be open sometime?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

The bar is a part of the clubhouse, located on the ground floor. It was once open and runned by the old SV, however, it has been closed for some years now. 

Currently, we are doing an outdoor Bar event every two weeks! Look out for information about the dates on the posters in Eichkamp and in the Telegram group :)

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I ensure my bike is protected from rain?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Every house (except houses 11 & 12) offers a bike storage room in the basement. Normally, every resident of the house has access to the room with their normal key for the front door. Just try out which door fits your key :)

<details>
<summary><strong>How can I repair my bike?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Apart from official (and expensive) repair services, such as Zweirad-Stadler, there is a self-service bike repair workshop at TU Berlin, called unirad ([http://unirad.blogsport.de/](http://unirad.blogsport.de/)). Something similar also exists at HU Berlin, called hubSCHRAUBER ([http://www.refrat.hu-berlin.de/hubschrauber/](http://www.refrat.hu-berlin.de/hubschrauber/))

Furthermore, the SV in Eichkamp wants to open the same kind of workshop directly in Eichkamp! The room and some tools are already there, because the workshop already existed in the past and was run by the old SV. Stay tuned for upcoming announcements and contact the SV if you want to get involved!

<summary><strong>What are cool things to do in the area of Eichkamp?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

You probably noticed the **stadium** right in front of the dormitory, the Mommsenstadion. Only a few people know that you can just go inside and use the area to workout! It is usually open to the public from around 7:30 am to around 21:30 pm. The hours can slightly change sometimes. If there is an event, the stadium is obviously closed for the public. 

If you want to do sports lessons, you can use the advantage of the **TU sports centre** being right next to the dorm! There are courses offered primarily for students of Berlin universities. They are usually very affordable for students. You can [look up their course program online](https://www.tu-sport.de/).

Close to the dormitory is also the **Teufelsberg and the Drachenberg**. The Teufelsberg is quite famous in Berlin and there is a big former listening device on top of it, now it’s mostly a ruin. Also there are some exhibitions or events sometimes, and sometimes you can get a drink. You have to pay a small entrance fee though. The Drachenberg is just a hill with a flat surface. You can go up to see the sunset, to have a great overview of the city, just to chill or to sled in winter.

If you looked around the dormitory grounds a little bit, you may have noticed that there is a special house right adjacent to the Eichkamp dormitory, the so-called **Bonhoefferhaus** at Marienburger Allee. It was the family home of the famous anti-Nazi dissident Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Today it is kind of a museum and there are sometimes guided tours. You can [inform yourself about it online](https://www.bonhoeffer-haus-berlin.de/).

<summary><strong>Where are the best grocery shopping possibilities? Is something open on sunday?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

At Theodor-Heuss-Platz, there is a really big and spacious REWE and an Aldi. Another REWE (somewhat smaller, but really good though) is at S Grunewald with a seperate beverages store. The next EDEKA is at Königin-Elisabeth-Straße.

If you really need something urgently on Sunday, you can go to Ulrich at S Zoo. It is one of the only grocery stores in the area that opens on Sundays :)

<details>
<summary><strong>Is there anything about the history of the dormitory?</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Yes! Have a look at http://eichkamp.net/. This is a web page by old Eichkampers, where they collected some material about their time at Eichkamp. Some of them even made a book about the history, which is available here: http://eichkamp.net/chronik/chronik.pdf 

Maybe we also provide historic material on the SV website in the future :)
